<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X-Ray Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intraoral X-rays</li><li>Extraoral X-rays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental X-ray market consists of two main types: intraoral X-rays and extraoral X-rays. Intraoral X-rays involve placing a film inside the patient's mouth to capture detailed images of specific teeth or sections. They are commonly used for diagnosing tooth decay, periodontal diseases, and assessing root canal treatments. Extraoral X-rays, on the other hand, capture images of the entire mouth, jaw, and skull. They are typically used to evaluate the position and development of teeth, detect tumors or cysts, and plan orthodontic treatments. Both types play a crucial role in dental diagnostics and treatment planning.</p></p>
