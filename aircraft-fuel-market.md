<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Fuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Avgas</li><li>Jet Fuel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft fuel market consists of two main types - Avgas and Jet Fuel. Avgas, short for aviation gasoline, is a specialized fuel used primarily by piston-engine aircraft. It contains low levels of lead and has a higher octane rating compared to regular gasoline. On the other hand, Jet Fuel, also known as aviation turbine fuel (ATF), is used by jet engines and turboprop aircraft. It has a higher energy density and different specifications compared to Avgas due to the different engine requirements and performance characteristics of jet-powered aircraft.</p></p>
