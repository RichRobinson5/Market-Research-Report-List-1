<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Guided Torpedo Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heavyweight Torpedo</li><li>Lightweight Torpedo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-guided torpedo market consists of two main types: heavyweight torpedoes and lightweight torpedoes. Heavyweight torpedoes are larger, equipped with more powerful warheads, and have longer ranges, making them suitable for anti-submarine warfare and ship targets. On the other hand, lightweight torpedoes are smaller and more maneuverable, ideal for surface vessel and anti-torpedo defense. Both types are self-propelled, self-guided weapons that use sophisticated sensors, navigation systems, and propulsion mechanisms to autonomously track and hit their targets underwater.</p></p>
