<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuroprotective Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinesterase inhibitors</li><li>NMDA receptor antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Neuroprotective products are aimed at protecting and preserving the health of neurons in the brain. Cholinesterase inhibitors are a type of neuroprotective product that work by blocking the enzyme cholinesterase, improving nerve cell communication and memory function. NMDA receptor antagonists, on the other hand, act by blocking the NMDA receptors in the brain, preventing excessive activation and reducing neurological damage. Both types of products are used in the treatment of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders to slow down the progression of symptoms and improve cognitive function.</p></p>
