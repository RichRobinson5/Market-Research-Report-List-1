<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Halogen-Free Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Hydroxide</li><li>Organo-Phosphorus</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The halogen-free flame retardant market can be classified into two major types: aluminum hydroxide and organo-phosphorus. Aluminum hydroxide is a commonly used flame retardant due to its excellent smoke suppression and low toxicity properties. It releases water vapor when exposed to high temperatures, which dilutes flammable gases. On the other hand, organo-phosphorus flame retardants work by forming a protective layer on the material surface, hindering the combustion process. They are known for their high thermal stability and compatibility with various polymers. Both types play crucial roles in reducing fire hazards without the use of halogenated compounds.</p></p>
