<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Medical X-ray detectors are used in radiology to capture X-ray images of patients. Two main types of detectors are indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use scintillator materials that convert X-rays into visible light, which is then converted to an electrical signal by a photodiode or a CCD camera. Direct conversion detectors directly convert X-rays into electrical signals using semiconductor materials, eliminating the need for scintillator conversion. Both types have their advantages and limitations, and their use depends on specific medical imaging applications.</p></p>
