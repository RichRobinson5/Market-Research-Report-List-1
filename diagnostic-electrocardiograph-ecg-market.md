<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diagnostic Electrocardiograph (ECG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resting ECG</li><li>Stress ECG</li><li>Holter ECG</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The diagnostic electrocardiograph (ECG) market consists of three main types: resting ECG, stress ECG, and holter ECG. Resting ECG is conducted while the patient is at rest, measuring the heart's electrical activity. Stress ECG is performed during exercise or physical stress to evaluate heart function under exertion. Holter ECG involves wearing a portable device that continually records the heart's electrical signals over a prolonged period, typically 24 to 48 hours. All three types aid in diagnosing heart conditions, providing valuable insights into cardiac health.</p></p>
