<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capnography Equipments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mainstream Capnographys</li><li>Sidestream Capnographys</li><li>Microstream Capnographys</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Capnography equipment is used to measure the concentration of carbon dioxide in a patient's breath during anesthesia and respiratory treatments. There are three main types of capnography equipment: mainstream, sidestream, and microstream capnographs. Mainstream capnographs have a sensor directly attached to the patient's airway, providing real-time measurements. Sidestream capnographs have a sampling tube connected to the patient's airway, analyzing gas samples sent from the patient to the monitor. Microstream capnographs use a microsample of the patient's breath to measure carbon dioxide levels, and are typically used in non-intubated patients.</p></p>
