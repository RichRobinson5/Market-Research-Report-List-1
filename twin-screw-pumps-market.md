<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Twin-Screw Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sealed Twin-Screw Pump</li><li>Non-sealed Twin-Screw Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Twin-Screw Pumps market consists of two main types: Sealed Twin-Screw Pump and Non-sealed Twin-Screw Pump. The Sealed Twin-Screw Pump is designed with a sealing system that prevents leakage of materials being pumped. This ensures safety, minimizes environmental impact, and allows for a wider range of applications. On the other hand, the Non-sealed Twin-Screw Pump does not have a sealing system and may experience some leakage. This type is generally used in applications where small amounts of leakage can be tolerated and where cost-effectiveness is a priority.</p></p>
