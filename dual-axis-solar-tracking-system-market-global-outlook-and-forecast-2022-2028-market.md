<p><strong>The Dual-Axis Solar Tracking System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2022-2028 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polar-axis Tracking</li><li>Altitudeâ€“azimuth Tracking</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The dual-axis solar tracking system market refers to the industry that focuses on the development and production of solar tracking systems that can track the movement of the sun in two axes. This technology allows solar panels to adjust their position and orientation throughout the day, maximizing their exposure to sunlight and increasing energy production. The market outlook and forecast for this industry indicate significant growth potential from 2022 to 2028. There are two main types of dual-axis solar tracking systems: polar-axis tracking and altitude-azimuth tracking. Polar-axis tracking involves tilting solar panels in a north-south direction to follow the sun's movement from east to west. Altitude-azimuth tracking, on the other hand, adjusts solar panels' angle and rotation to track the sun's daily path, which varies based on latitude and season. Both types of solar tracking systems offer increased energy efficiency and are expected to gain popularity in the forecasted period.</p></p>
