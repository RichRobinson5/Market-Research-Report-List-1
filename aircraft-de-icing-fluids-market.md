<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft De-Icing Fluids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ethylene Glycol</li><li>Propylene Glycol</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aircraft de-icing fluids market consists of three main types: ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and others. Ethylene glycol de-icing fluids are widely used due to their low cost and excellent ice-melting properties. Propylene glycol de-icing fluids offer significant environmental advantages as they are less toxic and biodegradable. The "others" category includes alternative de-icing fluids like hot water and potassium acetate. Despite being effective in de-icing, these alternatives are less commonly used and have limitations in certain weather conditions. These variations in de-icing fluids cater to different preferences and specific requirements within the aviation industry.</p></p>
