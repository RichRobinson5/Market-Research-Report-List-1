<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Composite Liftgate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Power Liftgate</li><li>Hands-free Power Liftgate</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive composite liftgate market includes two main types: conventional power liftgate and hands-free power liftgate. Conventional power liftgate is a type where the liftgate can be operated using a power button or a key fob to open or close it. On the other hand, hands-free power liftgate is a type where the liftgate can be opened or closed without physically touching it, usually by making a kicking motion under the rear bumper to activate the sensor. Both types provide convenience and ease of use for vehicle owners.</p></p>
