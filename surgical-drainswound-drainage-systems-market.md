<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drains/Wound Drainage Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Surgical Drains/Wound Drainage Systems market is divided into two main types: Passive Drains and Active Drains. Passive drains are devices that work without any external force, using gravity or capillary action to allow fluid to flow out of the wound. Active drains, on the other hand, require external pressure, such as a vacuum or bulb suction, to promote fluid drainage. Both types of drains are used post-surgery to remove excess fluid or blood from wounds, aiding in the healing process.</p></p>
