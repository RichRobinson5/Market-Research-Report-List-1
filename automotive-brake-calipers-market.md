<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Calipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating Brake Calipers</li><li>Fixed Brake Calipers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive brake calipers come in two main types: Floating Brake Calipers and Fixed Brake Calipers. Floating calipers are designed with pistons on only one side and are mounted on pins that allow them to move slightly. These calipers are less expensive and offer simpler designs, making them more common in smaller vehicles. Fixed brake calipers, on the other hand, have pistons on both sides and are rigidly mounted. They provide better braking performance and are often found in high-performance and luxury vehicles, though they tend to be more expensive.</p></p>
