<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Emulsion Graft Copolymerization</li><li>Bulk Copolymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) Resin market consists of two main types: Emulsion Graft Copolymerization and Bulk Copolymerization. In Emulsion Graft Copolymerization, the ABS resin is synthesized by polymerizing styrene and acrylonitrile on a butadiene rubber backbone in an emulsion system. This process provides ABS with good impact strength and heat resistance. On the other hand, Bulk Copolymerization involves polymerizing styrene and acrylonitrile with butadiene rubber in a bulk system. This method results in ABS resin with high toughness and good dimensional stability.</p></p>
