<p><strong>The Automotive Seat Belt Pretensioners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Electrical</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive seat belt pretensioners are safety features that help secure passengers in a vehicle during a collision. Mechanical pretensioners use mechanical force to retract the seat belt and remove any slack, keeping the passenger firmly in place. Electrical pretensioners, on the other hand, rely on electrical inputs to activate a small explosive device, which tightens the seat belt instantaneously. Both types serve the same purpose of minimizing the forward movement of passengers and preventing injuries in the event of a crash.</p></p>
