<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geotextiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Woven</li><li>Woven</li><li>Knitted</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The geotextiles market can be divided into three main types: Non-Woven, Woven, and Knitted. Non-woven geotextiles are made by entangling fibers together using heat or chemicals, providing excellent filtration and separation properties. Woven geotextiles are formed by weaving individual fibers together, creating a strong and durable fabric that is particularly suited for erosion control and reinforcement applications. Knitted geotextiles are created by interlocking loops of yarn, offering superior drainage and soil stabilization capabilities. These three types of geotextiles cater to different needs in the construction and civil engineering industries.</p></p>
