<p><strong>VPM1002 (Tuberculosis BCG Based Vaccine) Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>VPM1002 is a tuberculosis vaccine that is based on the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. The BCG vaccine, developed in the 1920s, has been used as a preventive measure against tuberculosis for decades. However, its efficacy is limited, prompting the development of VPM1002 as a potential improvement. </p><p>One of the key players in the VPM1002 market is Vakzine Projekt Management (VPM). VPM is a German biotechnology company that specializes in the development of vaccines. The company has an extensive background in tuberculosis research and has been involved in the development of VPM1002. VPM has conducted various clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. The company is currently working towards obtaining regulatory approvals for the vaccine.</p><p>Another major player in the VPM1002 market is the Serum Institute of India. The Serum Institute of India is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by doses produced. The institute has a long history of vaccine production and has a strong presence in the global vaccine market. The Serum Institute of India has been actively involved in the research and development of VPM1002, and it plays a critical role in the production and distribution of the vaccine.</p><p>The market for VPM1002 is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The demand for an improved tuberculosis vaccine is high, especially in countries with a high burden of the disease. The World Health Organization estimates that around 10 million people develop tuberculosis each year, and VPM1002 could potentially provide a more effective and long-lasting solution compared to traditional BCG vaccines.</p><p>The exact market size and sales revenue of the VPM1002 players are not publicly disclosed. However, given the potential market demand and the involvement of major players like VPM and the Serum Institute of India, it can be expected that the sales revenue for these companies would be significant. The success of VPM1002 in obtaining regulatory approvals and its subsequent commercialization would play a crucial role in determining the market size and sales revenue of these companies in the future.</p></p>
