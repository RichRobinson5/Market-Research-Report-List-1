<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Electric Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal electric power generation encompasses three main market types. Dry steam stations utilize steam extracted from underground reservoirs to directly power the turbine generator. Flash steam power stations, on the other hand, harness high-temperature water from the reservoir and convert it into steam to drive the generator. Lastly, binary cycle stations work by utilizing the lower temperature geothermal resources to heat a working fluid, typically an organic compound, which then vaporizes and powers the generator. These market types differ in the way they harness geothermal energy to generate electricity.</p></p>
