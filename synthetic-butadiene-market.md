<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Butadiene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidative Dehydrogenation</li><li>Extractive Distillation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic butadiene is produced through two primary methods: oxidative dehydrogenation and extractive distillation. Oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of catalysts to convert butene into butadiene. This method is preferred for its high selectivity and low energy consumption. On the other hand, extractive distillation involves the separation of butadiene from other hydrocarbons using a solvent. This method is known for its high purity and production efficiency. Both methods play a crucial role in meeting the growing demand for butadiene, which is widely used in the production of synthetic rubber and various chemical products.</p></p>
