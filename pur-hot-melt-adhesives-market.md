<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PUR Hot-Melt Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reactive PUR Hot-Melt Adhesives</li><li>Reactive PUR Hot-Melt Adhesives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PUR hot-melt adhesives are classified into two main types: non-reactive PUR hot-melt adhesives and reactive PUR hot-melt adhesives. Non-reactive PUR hot-melt adhesives are applied in their existing state, without any chemical reactions occurring during the bonding process. On the other hand, reactive PUR hot-melt adhesives undergo a chemical reaction, usually triggered by moisture or heat, which causes them to achieve their maximum bonding strength. Both types have their specific uses and advantages, depending on the desired application and bonding requirements.</p></p>
