<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Inks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based Pharmaceutical Inks</li><li>Solvent-based Pharmaceutical Inks</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pharmaceutical inks are used for printing precise information on pharmaceutical packaging materials. There are two main types of pharmaceutical inks - water-based and solvent-based. Water-based pharmaceutical inks are made by dispersing pigments in water and are considered safer, more environmentally friendly, and easily removable. On the other hand, solvent-based pharmaceutical inks are made by dissolving pigments in organic solvents, which provide better adhesion, durability, and resistance to moisture. However, solvent-based inks can pose safety and environmental concerns due to the presence of volatile organic compounds.</p></p>
