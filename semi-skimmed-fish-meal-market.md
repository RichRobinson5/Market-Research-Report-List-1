<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-Skimmed Fish Meal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flame Dried (FD) Fish Meal</li><li>Steam Dried (SD) Fish Meal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Semi-skimmed fish meal is categorized into two types: Flame Dried (FD) Fish Meal and Steam Dried (SD) Fish Meal. Flame Dried Fish Meal is produced by rapidly flame-drying the fish to remove excess moisture, resulting in a high-quality protein-rich product. Steam Dried Fish Meal, on the other hand, is produced by steam-cooking the fish, followed by drying and grinding. This process helps retain more of the fishâ€™s natural oils and ingredients, making it suitable for animal feed formulations requiring higher fat content. Both types play crucial roles in the fish meal market catering to different nutritional needs.</p></p>
