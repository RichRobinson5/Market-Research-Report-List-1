<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Laboratory Micro-sealers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laser</li><li>Infrared</li><li>Pulse ARC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dental laboratory micro-sealers are used for sealing dental appliances, such as crowns and bridges, to ensure a proper fit and prevent leakage. The market offers three types of micro-sealers: laser, infrared, and pulse ARC. Laser micro-sealers utilize laser technology to create a precise and strong dental seal. Infrared micro-sealers use infrared radiation to heat and melt the dental material, forming a tight seal. Pulse ARC micro-sealers generate intense heat through electric arcs to bond the dental components together. These different types provide dentists and dental technicians with options to find the best micro-sealer for their specific needs.</p></p>
