<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Touch Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive</li><li>Capacitive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Touch sensors are electronic devices that detect physical touch or pressure on a surface and convert it into a digital signal. There are two main types of touch sensors in the market. Resistive touch sensors consist of two conductive layers separated by a non-conductive layer. When pressure is applied, the layers touch each other, completing a circuit and registering the touch. Capacitive touch sensors use an electric field to detect touch. They have a conductive layer that stores electrical charge, and when touched, the charge dislocates, triggering a response.</p></p>
