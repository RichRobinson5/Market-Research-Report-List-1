<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Electrocardiographs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multiple Chanels</li><li>Single Chanel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A multiple-channel veterinary electrocardiograph is a medical device used to measure the electrical activity of a pet's heart using multiple leads. It allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the heart's function and can detect abnormalities in different areas. On the other hand, a single-channel veterinary electrocardiograph utilizes only one lead to measure the heart's electrical activity, providing a more basic assessment of cardiac function. Both types of electrocardiographs are valuable tools for veterinarians in diagnosing and monitoring heart conditions in animals.</p></p>
